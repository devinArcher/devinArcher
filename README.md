|  <p align="left"> Devin Archer! -ˋˏ✄┈┈┈ illistrator and writer! -ˋˏ✄┈┈┈ ‼️18 : TME‼️ -ˋˏ✄┈┈┈┈ I'm also a sys but tbh none of my alters use PT so it doesn't matter. <br>  ׅ 𝄂𝄚𝅦𝄚𝄞𝅄ㅤ <br> Hi I'm a girl freak. I overshare at docks because I'm bored and an attention seeking misile. Any girls? Anywhere at all? can I get a scratch? even a pet? <br>ㅤ ׅ 𝄂𝄚𝅦𝄚𝄞𝅄ㅤ <br> I have an assortment of fetishes and what I can't fetishize personally I will still talk about with those who do enjoy it. Uhm. Other than sex I like to write about trauma and my OCD, through the lense of my barely disguised fetishes. No DNI, but I will not tolerate transmisogyny around me. I want to be a safe space for every girl. </p> |      <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6f540329c9251744de81f0341ca17f8a/f350166c7dcdc868-6f/s2048x3072/fc7bb36c9b67faca3da03501ff28f1a7caef1bc5.jpg">             |

I also think yall act like stamping down a No Predators sign like Elmer Fudd on a hunting trip is the best form of protection you can provide for kids. Yall act like that absolves you from trying to dismantle any of the systemic and social power structures that result in abuse. Yall act like a passive participant in what is an active hold of a child's agency and identity. You are an active participant. I don't care how kind or guiding or progressive you think you're being, you have power over them that you need to keep in check. It's moronic and I hope to see people do better. <br> I will literally Northern Lion crash out about this, you don't believe that these are real people. You don't believe that these are real people with interiority and autonomy of their own. Real people trying to form their own opinions and speak their own perspectives. You believe you're the only real person, I'm going crazy. Saying this since I'm not gonna be playing on safe as much anymore and I want to seperate the wheat from the chaff in terms of people I interact with. |
