I overshare at docks because I'm bored and an attention seeking misile. Any girls? Anywhere at all? can I get a scratch? even a pet? <br>ㅤ ׅ 𝄂𝄚𝅦𝄚𝄞𝅄ㅤ <br> I have an assortment of fetishes and what I can't fetishize personally I will still talk about with those who do enjoy it. Uhm. Other than sex I like to write about trauma and my OCD, through the lense of my barely disguised fetishes. No DNI, but I will not tolerate transmisogyny around me. I want to be a safe space for every girl. </p> |      <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6f540329c9251744de81f0341ca17f8a/f350166c7dcdc868-6f/s2048x3072/fc7bb36c9b67faca3da03501ff28f1a7caef1bc5.jpg">             |

| <b> Rant of the Month: </b> <br> <br> Okay so this anime was lowkey so bad but for a brief moment, this show had a glimmer of beauty to me and I'm kind of obsessed with it. <br> In my own mind I have rebuilt this show as an anime about a young woman who has had her agency constantly at the whim of other people. She's transgender, she's disabled, and everyone percieves her as a kid, and these things make people around her assume control and entitlement over her life. They get to decide when she can or cannot feel anger, sorrow, or love. They get to decide when she is held responsible and when she cannot make decisions for herself. And I honestly wish the show went in a more explicit direction focusing on Kei and Kazami trying to form a relationship despite this. <br> Ms. Kazami was not a perfect woman, she contributed in some ways to the power held over Kei, but she was willing to try working against that. I honestly would have loved to see that explored too. Two women making mistakes that hurt eachother's feelings but trying to become better people afterwards. Forgiving eachother for being hurt. Forgiving themselves. <br> Anyways it pmo that the anime ended with an useless oyakodon centered fanservice episode but ykw that's my fault for spinning a teacher/student f/m anime into whatever I just described. Don't watch Onegai Teacher, I just lied to you. BUT SHE LOOKS CUTE DOESN'T SHE? I LOOKED AT THE PROMO MATERIALS AND I'M LIKE THAT HAS TO BE A GIRL, I'M NOT CRAZY, THAT'S A GIRL??!?? | <video width="630" height="300" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698c2d20-c32d-433a-9629-23c90499427d"> |
